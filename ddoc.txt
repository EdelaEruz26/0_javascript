shopping cart demo!


first, the shopping cart. The cart is a txt file with a product list written 
in json.

The cart contains:
    - a list of products
The cart can perform the following actions:
    - add product(s)
    - delete product(s)
    - update a product quantity

(the cart checkout is considered as a user action)

second, the warehouse. The warehouse is just another term for the warehouse.txt 
file. It simply contains products (it can be viewed as a product list). It can 
only be manipulated directly (by editing the file). Each time a product is 
checked out, the warehouse has to be updated.

The warehouse can perform the following actions:
    - filter (by name, price or category)

finally, the product:

A product has the following attributes:
    - id
    - name
    - price
    - category
    - quantity

lastly, the 'user' can perform the following action:
    - checkout


putting it in rest api terms:

shopping cart routes:
    - get /cart : list the products in the cart.
    - delete /cart : empty the cart.

shopping cart product routes:
    - post /cart/products/:product : add a new product to the cart (product is
    a json object).
    - put /cart/products/:id/:quantity : update a product quantity in the 
    cart.
    - delete /cart/products/:id : delete a product in the cart.

warehouse routes:
    - get /warehouse : returns everything in the warehouse.
    - get /warehouse/:filterType/:keyword : filter warehouse items. filterType
    can be 'name', 'price' or 'category'. keyword is the filter word that will 
    be used.

'user' routes:
    - post /checkout : checks out. returns the total or an error message.

the warehouse is updated when the user executes a checkout.
