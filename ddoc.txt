shopping cart demo!


first, the shopping cart. The cart is a txt file with a product list written 
in json.

The cart contains:
    - a list of products
The cart can perform the following actions:
    - add product(s)
    - delete product(s)

(the cart checkout is considered as a user action)

now, the warehouse. The warehouse is just another term for the warehouse.txt 
file. It simply contains products (it can be viewed as a product list). It can 
only be manipulated directly (by editing the file). Each time a product is 
checked out, the warehouse has to be updated.

finally, the product:

A product has the following attributes:
    - id
    - name
    - price
    - category
    - quantity


putting it in rest api terms:

shopping cart routes:
    - get /cart: list the products in the cart
    - put /cart : update the cart
    - delete /cart : empty the cart

'user' routes:
    - post /checkout: checks out

the warehouse is updated when the user executes a checkout.
